# hello-world
Hello gitters!
This is my first hello-world in GitHub. I am a student who wants to learn how to code by herself and hoppefully become a developer in 2 years. 
So I understood that branches help people to not mess up the MAIN file, is that true? If yes, then I suppose that GitHub must not suffer from the mess that I am going to create.
Anyways, 
Happy coding!
